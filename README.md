# Proyecto Titanic de Kaggle
## Description
This project is my submission for the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition on Kaggle. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on a dataset containing information such as age, gender, ticket class, and other factors.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in:

- Data Analysis: Experience in exploring, cleaning, and visualizing data using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

- Feature Engineering: Ability to design and construct new features from existing data to optimize model performance.

- Machine Learning Modeling: Capacity to train and evaluate various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using Scikit-learn.

- Model Optimization: Skill in hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.

- Communication: Effective presentation of findings and methodologies through this README.
